SNFinance is a Google Script file that contains useful financial/economic functions for use in Google Spreadsheets.  It's a work in progress, feel free to issue pull requests with enhancments, I'll review and add.

Here are things I'd like to get done:
* More risk free rate methods (3 month, two year, five year, and 30 year)
* Function for extracting Financial Report line items from Google Finance.
* APIs (OECD, Federal Reserve Economic Data [FRED], Census.gov, ...)
